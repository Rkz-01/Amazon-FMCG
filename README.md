# Amazon-FMCG
Amazon's extensive warehouse network is facing operational inefficiencies leading to frequent stockouts, delivery delays, and increased costs. As a data analyst, my task is to analyze warehouse data to uncover the root causes and provide data-driven solutions. Addressing these inefficiencies is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction, reducing operational costs, and ensuring timely deliveries, thereby maintaining Amazon's competitive edge in the retail market. This involves identifying key performance indicators and analyzing data on warehouse capacity, refill requests, transport issues, competitor presence, retail shops served, product storage requirements, electric supply, worker numbers, establishment years, and reported issues to optimize warehouse performance.
